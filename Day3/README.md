# 🚀 Day 3 – C++ Practice Projects

## 🧠 Overview
Today's focus was on reinforcing control flow, randomness, and user interaction in C++. These mini-projects were built by following Bro Code tutorials, with personal touches added to enhance engagement and creativity. The plan is to complete tutorial-based projects first, then transition to original personal projects.

## 🎲 Project 1: Dice Roller

### 📂 File
- `dice_roller.cpp`

### 📥 Input
- User presses Enter to initiate the roll

### 📤 Output
- Random number between 1 and 6
- Friendly message displaying the result

### 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- `srand(time(NULL))` for random seed
- `rand() % 6 + 1` for dice logic
- `cin.ignore()` for user-triggered action
- Console formatting and user prompts

## 🎁 Project 2: Lucky Draw Simulator

### 📂 File
- `lucky_draw.cpp`

### 📥 Input
- User presses Enter to draw a prize

- Randomly selected prize from 5 options

### 🎉 Prizes
- 💻 Brand-new laptop  
- 🎧 Wireless headphones  
- 🍕 Pizza voucher  
- 📚 Bookstore gift card  
- 🎮 Gaming controller

### 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- `rand()` and `srand(time(0))` for randomness
- `switch-case` branching logic
- Console formatting with borders and emojis

## 🎯 Project 3: Number Guessing Game

### 📂 File
- `number_guessing.cpp`

### 📥 Input
- User guesses a number between 1 and 100

### 📤 Output
- Feedback: `"Too high!"`, `"Too low!"`, or `"CORRECT!"`
- Displays number of attempts

### 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- `do-while` loop for repeated input
- `rand()` for target number
- Input validation and feedback
- Attempt tracking with `tries++`
